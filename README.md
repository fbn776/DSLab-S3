# Data Structures Lab - S3

## Questions

### Cycle - 1 (C lang review)

1. You are given two arrays sorted in ascending order. Write a C Program to merge the elements of the two arrays and to form a single array sorted in ascending order.
2. Given a string s, write a C program to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. Also, display the substring.
3. Write a program to find the smallest number in a list of integers using pointers
4. Implement the following string library functions using pointers:
   - string length (`int StringLength (char *s)`)
   - string copy (`void StringCopy(char *s1, char *s2)`)
   - string comparison (`int StringCompare (char *s1, char *s2)`)
   - string concatenation (`void StringConcat(char *s1, char *s2)`)
5. Implement bubble sort without using an array (Use pointers instead)


### Cycle - 2 (Search)

1. Implement Linear Search.
2. Implement Binary Search.
3. Implement Stack using an array.
4. Write a program in C to check whether a string is palindrome or not, using stack.

### Cycle - 3

1. Using stack, convert an infix expression to a postfix expression and evaluate the postfix expression.
2. Write a program to convert an infix expression to a prefix expression using stack.
3. Convert an infix expression to a postfix expression without using stack.
4. Implement a Queue using arrays with the operations:
   - Insert elements into the queue 
   - Delete elements from the queue
   - Display the contents of the queue after each operation
5. Implement a Circular Queue using arrays with the operations:
   - Insert elements into the queue
   - Delete elements from the queue
   - Display the contents of the queue after each operation
6. Implement a Priority Queue using arrays with the operations:
   - Insert elements into the queue
   - Delete elements from the queue
   - Display the contents of the queue after each operation
7. Implement a Double-Ended Queue using arrays with the operations:
   - Insert elements into the queue (both front and rear)
   - Delete elements from the queue (both front and rear)
   - Display the contents of the queue after each operation
